<p align="center">
    A Minimal Web-App Platform, so that you don't have to start over again.
</p>

## Introduction
<p>
<b>A</b>no<b>GR</b>e<b>S</b>, short for Anonymous Greivance Reporting System, began its journey as a simple application intended for a university course submittion. However after a little bit of revaluation I decided to turn it into a little more ambitious project.<br/>
The name just stuck along.
</p>

<br />
<br />

## The goal
<br />

<p>
The goal of AnoGReS will be provide developers with a minimal platform to kickstart their applications without having to write some basic code (front and back-end) over and over again.
</p>

<br />

<p>
As an initial goal, I plan to provide developers with a single minimal, material theme based cross-platform web app that can be adapted to the developer's liking.<br />
Other developments may follow later.
